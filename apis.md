description: As network and service operators and developers, we&rsquo;ve spent our
  entire professional lives designing and running large-scale networks and CDNs. With
  decades of experience, we know the shortcomings of available tools. What we always
  wanted &mdash; but never found &mdash; was an infrastructure visibility solution
  that&rsquo;s scalable, powerful, easy to use, and affordable. We started Kentik
  to create that solution.
